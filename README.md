Prerequisites
=============

These simulation scenarios should work with the following versions of NS3, ndnSIM 2.0 and ndn-cxx:

- NS3 + ndnSIM: https://github.com/spirosmastorakis/NS3-ndnSIM-NDN-Link-Layer-Reliability

- ndn-cxx: https://github.com/vusirikala/ndn-cxx

The code may not work with a vanilla version of ndnSIM.

For more information how to install NS-3, ndnSIM and how to compile, please refer to http://ndnsim.net/2.0/ website.

For more information on how to compile the scenarios, please take a look here: https://github.com/named-data-ndnSIM/scenario-template

Compiling
=========

To configure in optimized mode without logging **(default)**:

    ./waf configure

To configure in optimized mode with scenario logging enabled (logging in NS-3 and ndnSIM modules will still be disabled,
but you can see output from NS_LOG* calls from your scenarios and extensions):

    ./waf configure --logging

To configure in debug mode with all logging enabled

    ./waf configure --debug

If you have installed NS-3 in a non-standard location, you may need to set up ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` variable.

Running
=======

Normally, you can run scenarios either directly

    ./build/<scenario_name>

or using waf

    ./waf --run <scenario_name>

If NS-3 is installed in a non-standard location, on some platforms (e.g., Linux) you need to specify ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` variable:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./build/<scenario_name>

or

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./waf --run <scenario_name>

To run scenario using debugger, use the following command:

    gdb --args ./build/<scenario_name>


Running with visualizer
-----------------------

There are several tricks to run scenarios in visualizer.  Before you can do it, you need to set up environment variables for python to find visualizer module.  The easiest way to do it using the following commands:

    cd ns-dev/ns-3
    ./waf shell

After these command, you will have complete environment to run the vizualizer.

The following will run scenario with visualizer:

    ./waf --run <scenario_name> --vis

or

    PKG_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./waf --run <scenario_name> --vis

If you want to request automatic node placement, set up additional environment variable:

    NS_VIS_ASSIGN=1 ./waf --run <scenario_name> --vis

or

    PKG_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib NS_VIS_ASSIGN=1 ./waf --run <scenario_name> --vis
